Application : SpeedoMeter and Tachometer Simulation in Android.
Implemented : SpeedoMeter simulation completely implemented with SurfaceView with 60fps. Tachometer is partially implemented with view. It has to follow same implementation as speedometer. 
Compentents used : SurfaceView, View, Handler, Thread, ValueAnimator, Canvas.
Functionality : 
On launching the application, speed simulation with animation will be started for the first time. 
To see the animation/speed simulation, click over the speedometer to restart speed simulation/animation.
SpeedoMeter frame rate is set to 60fps and Tachometer is without fps implemention. So, We can see slight judder in Tachometer.
TODO or Improvement:
1. Code Cleanup. 
2. Comments to be added.
3. Checking for performance and memory. (onDraw is optimized)
